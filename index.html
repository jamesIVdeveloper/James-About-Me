      <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>
          Currently, I am enrolled at Thinkful to become a software engineer.  The more I learn about coding and developing, the more I enjoy it.  It combines technicality, patience, and aesthetics to create great software.  I look forward to learning more, as I want to continue to create more detailed projects.  Also, I look forward to working with other developers.  The more minds you have on a project, the more creativity is brought to the table, making for some exciting results.
        </p>
