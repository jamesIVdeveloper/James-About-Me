      <h1>
        Hello!  My name is James Murphy.
      </h1>
        <p>
          I am an aspiring software developer living in Greenville, SC.  Currently, I am working as a Personal Trainer.  If you are interested in hiring a software developer, or getting ripped for that upcoming vacation, feel free to <a href="#contact">Contact me!</a>
        </p>
      <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Currently, I am enrolled at Thinkful to become a software engineer.  The more I learn about coding and developing, the more I enjoy it.  It combines technicality, patience, and aesthetics to create great software.  I look forward to learning more, as I want to continue to create more detailed projects.  Also, I look forward to working with other developers.  The more minds you have on a project, the more creativity is brought to the table, making for some exciting results.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I am not coding, I enjoy playing a round of golf, or grabing some drinks with freinds.  If I'm not doing either of those, you can probably find me playing xbox.
        </p>
